Despite of being a full time

As a university student, it is not just going to class and learn what are being thought.
Knowing that my adulthood is just another step away, I have made myself well prepared 
with additional skills that I think it may be needed in the future.

Microsoft Office is the most fundemantals of everything. My skills may include
Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Along with that, I have found myself has an interest in digital designing 
and so I have learnt to design using Adobe Illustrator for the purpose in making posters. I am also
planning to widen this skills and venture more into logo designing. Other software that has catched my
interest is Adobe Premiere Pro, and it is very convenient to use for video editing.

Apart from softwares that may seems unrelated with engineering, I am also well prepared with 
some other skills such as LabVIEW which I use for Data Acquisition and SOLIDWORKS for designing 
mechanical part such as bolt, nut and many more. In term of computer languages, I have acquire
C++, HTML & CSS and a little bit of Phyton. Frankly speaking, this website I made is from HTML & CSS
by modifying the code I downloaded from HTML5UP.

Despite being well rounded with academical skills, I am also an active student in term of sport. I 
play tennis as for my main sport. Other sports may indclude running, badminton, swimming and gymnasium.
Dancing is also my forte and I have some basic in zapin, inang, boria and some other creative dances.
